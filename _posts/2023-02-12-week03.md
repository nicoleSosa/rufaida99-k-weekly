## Git Activity

I understood a majority of the actvitiy, but got stuck on the part about 2 copies of the same repository. I had never done the upstream branch, or worked with making changes, commits, and pushes to the upstream branch. It was fun to learn in the group setting, and I did like the forking method a bit better, because it ensured even if I messed up, I would not be harming the original code. I can goof around on my own end, and test it out before making a pull request.

## Extension Team Work (YouTube Customizer)

I have made a Chrome Extension in the past, so making a Mozilla extension was a different experience but still felt familiar. I enjoyed going through all the new extensions on Mozilla, and trying out which ones I liked, which ones I really did not, and which ones I could possibly make myself. Working in a team was fun, and eduational because we all learned from each other, and we did a pretty good job overall. It was a little difficult to balance all the features I would want in an ideal world vs. the reality of a time constraint and limitations with JavaScript understanding. I also had a slight challenge with the creative aspect of the Extension, but towards the end, after continuous talks with my teammates, we were able to include a little bit of what everyone liked in the Extension from a creative standpoint. I enjoyed working with my team, and really love our end product!

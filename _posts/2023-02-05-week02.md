## Code of Conduct Activity 

### Part 1

When I read the code of conduct, I thought it was very explicit in its terms, and leaves very little room for any confusion or misinterpretation of the rules. I think if more projects had rules such as this, there would be a greater welcoming aspect to these open source communities. 

The Contributor Covenant code of conduct is a template, and the Go project just added their own "Gopher" values to their code.

### Part 2

The introductory paragraph for Sugar Lab's [Code of Conduct](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Sugar_Labs/Legal/Code_of_Conduct) seems to be unique, since they have tied their lab into the idea of sharing and promoting the concept of a community built software, but the rest of the document seems to be based off of another one. They mention this towards the end, where they state the Code of Conduct is based on the [Ubuntu Code Of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/governance/code-of-conduct), licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license. 


### Part 3
[MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/) is an open source project. It is a SQL server that integrates the machine learning algorithms directly into the database, and it has a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/staging/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in its github repository. It is pretty standard and it based on the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct 2.0. I like that the website's main page has a link for the slack channel, and a direct link to Github as well. They also have a tab for Community involvement, which is a good sign, and is welcoming. 

## Add-On-Activity

I have some experience with coding a Chrome Extension before, so to do so in a group activity was a new way of approaching something familiar. It was fairly easy to get through the first few parts of the activity, but it was only around part 5 that it felt a little more challenging. Coming up with ideas that nobody else has developed, or something that's exciting and fun, but also achievable is hard. I did learn more about Mozilla and the Add-Ons it has, along with different extensions. I think one of my favourite ones is the [Nyan Cat Progress Bar](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nyan-cat-progress-bar-for/bdjaekjkckpdknkfncfnaibkabdcgmkg?hl=en), which is partly responsible for inspiring my team (Group 4) to come up with a plan. I'm hoping it goes well, and we all have some fun while developing the extension :)
